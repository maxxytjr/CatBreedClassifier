# CatBreedClassifier
Cat Breed Classification

# Description
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to attempt at classifying cat breeds. The motive of this exercise is to detail the workflow from data prepraration, image augmentation, classifier training and visualization of training performance.

# Dataset
The cat breed classifier dataset can be downloaded from the Kaggle website [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ma7555/cat-breeds-dataset). 

# Files
You will find two jupyter notebooks; one that uses PyTorch for training and Tensorflow/Keras for the other.

# Results
  * Unable to attain a respectable validation accuracy. Will continue to find better ways to train the model.
  * Suggestions welcome
